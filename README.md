# Excercise brief:

## Caesar Cipher
Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c. \
Original alphabet: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \
Alphabet rotated +3: defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc
## Function Description
